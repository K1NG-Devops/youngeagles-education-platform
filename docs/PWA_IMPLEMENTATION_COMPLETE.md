- **Mobile-First Design**: Bottom navigation, responsive header

### âœ… Core Components Implemented
- **Login System**: Development-ready login with mock authentication
- **PWA Dashboard**: Parent and Teacher specific dashboards
- **Navigation**: Role-based bottom navigation bar
- **Offline Support**: Service worker with caching strategies
- **PWA Installation**: Install prompts and standalone detection

### âœ… Development Features
- **Development Mode**: Force PWA layout for testing
- **Mock Authentication**: Login with any credentials in dev mode
- **Hot Reload**: Full Vite development server
- **Build System**: Production-ready PWA build
