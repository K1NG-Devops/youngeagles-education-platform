# 🧪 PayFast Integration Test

## ✅ **What We've Implemented:**

### **1. PayFast Generated Form Integration**
- ✅ Used your exact PayFast generated form code  
- ✅ Receiver ID: `30921435` (from your PayFast dashboard)
- ✅ Correct PayFast URL: `https://payment.payfast.io/eng/process`
- ✅ Shipping address fields included
- ✅ Custom quantity functionality

### **2. Return URLs Configured**
- ✅ Success: `https://youngeagles-education-platform.vercel.app/donation-success`  
- ✅ Cancel: `https://youngeagles-education-platform.vercel.app/donation-cancelled`
- ✅ Webhook: `https://youngeagles-education-platform.vercel.app/api/payfast-webhook`

### **3. Dynamic Form Submission**
- ✅ Creates form with exact PayFast fields
- ✅ Populates amount from donation form
- ✅ Uses donation reference as `m_payment_id`
- ✅ Includes donor information in custom fields

## 🔍 **Test the Integration:**

### **1. Fill out donation form:**
- Enter donor details
- Select amount (e.g., R100)  
- Choose "PayFast" payment method
- Click "Pay Now with PayFast"

### **2. Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Donation record created in Supabase
- ✅ Browser redirects to PayFast payment page
- ✅ PayFast shows amount and item details
- ✅ After payment, redirects to success page

### **3. PayFast Payment Flow:**
```
Donation Form → Supabase Record → PayFast Payment → Success Page
```

## 🚨 **Important Notes:**

### **Receiver ID Match:**
- Your form uses receiver: `30921435`
- This MUST match your PayFast merchant account
- If wrong, payments will fail

### **Environment Status:**
- Using PayFast PRODUCTION URLs
- Make sure your PayFast account is live, not sandbox

### **Webhook Processing:**
- PayFast will send payment confirmations to `/api/payfast-webhook`
- This updates donation status in Supabase
- Triggers confirmation emails

## 🔧 **If PayFast Returns Error:**

### **Check These:**
1. **Receiver ID:** Verify `30921435` is your correct PayFast merchant ID
2. **Account Status:** Ensure PayFast account is active and verified  
3. **URLs:** Confirm return/cancel/notify URLs are accessible
4. **Amount:** PayFast has minimum amount requirements (usually R5.00)

## ✅ **Ready to Test!**

The integration now uses your exact PayFast generated form structure. Try making a test donation to see the full flow!

**Next Steps:**
1. Test with a small amount (R10-R20)
2. Verify PayFast payment page loads correctly
3. Complete a test payment
4. Check if webhook receives payment confirmation
