# Young Eagles PWA Restructure Summary

## Overview

We have successfully restructured the Young Eagles project by creating a separate Progressive Web App (PWA) that works alongside the existing frontend and backend applications. This separation allows for better organization, specific PWA optimizations, and easier maintenance.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created New PWA App Structure

```
pwa/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ icon-*.png          # PWA icons (72x72 to 512x512)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json       # Web app manifest
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ firebase-messaging-sw.js # Service worker for push notifications
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dashboard.jsx   # PWA dashboard with app install prompt
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Header.jsx      # Navigation with mobile-first design
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Homework.jsx    # Homework management with offline support
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Notifications.jsx # Push notification management
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ OfflineIndicator.jsx # Shows when user is offline
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx            # Main PWA app with routing and SW registration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.css          # PWA-specific styles
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.jsx           # App entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                   # PWA environment configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html            # PWA HTML with proper meta tags
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # PWA dependencies and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js    # Tailwind configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.js        # Vite with PWA plugin configuration
â””â”€â”€ README.md             # PWA-specific documentation
```

  "display": "standalone",
  "theme_color": "#2563eb",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "start_url": "/?source=pwa",
  "icons": [...],
  "shortcuts": [...]
}
```

#### Service Worker Features

### 6. Development Workflow

#### Separate Ports
- **API**: http://localhost:3001
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **PWA**: http://localhost:3002
- **Database**: http://localhost:8080 (phpMyAdmin)

#### Development Commands
```bash
# Individual apps
npm run dev:pwa          # Start PWA only
cd pwa && npm run dev    # Alternative PWA start

# All apps together
npm run start:all        # Start everything (uses start-all.sh)
npm run stop:all         # Stop everything (uses stop-all.sh)

# Building
npm run build:pwa        # Build PWA for production
cd pwa && npm run build  # Alternative PWA build
```
